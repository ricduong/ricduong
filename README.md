Hello üëã, I am [@ricduong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rickduong/), the Executive Director for the [Technology Partnership and Engineering]([url](https://partner.github.com/technology-partners)) team at [GitHub](http://github.com). GitHub is an ecosystem with over 100 million developers and our team works with over 900 partners to integrate their technology to help enable all of those developers.
I grew up in üêÇ Texas and live in the üèîÔ∏è Pacific Northwest where I enjoy üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è cycling and admire the üéá night sky as much as I can.
